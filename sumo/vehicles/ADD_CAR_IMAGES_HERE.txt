Instructions for Adding Custom Car Images
==========================================

To use custom car images instead of the default SUMO shapes:

1. Place your car images in this directory (sumo/vehicles/)
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 64x64 to 128x128 pixels
   - Top-down view of cars works best

2. Update highway.rou.xml:
   - Uncomment the vType with imgFile attribute
   - Comment out the vType without imgFile
   - Update the imgFile path to match your image filename

Example:
   <vType id="car" ... imgFile="vehicles/car_red.png"/>

3. In SUMO GUI:
   - Go to View Settings > Vehicle Shape
   - Select "raster images" option
   - Vehicles will now display using your custom images

Where to get car images:
- Search for "top down car png" on free image sites
- Use car clipart from openclipart.org or similar
- Create simple car silhouettes in any image editor

Note: The current setup uses built-in "passenger/sedan" shape which looks more car-like than arrows.
